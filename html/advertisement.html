        The star player in strawberries is vitamin C, an antioxidant that helps build and repair the body’s tissues, boosts immunity,
        and fights excess free radical damage. Studies also suggest vitamin C promotes healthy eye function and might even
        inhibit wrinkle formation (at least in mice!) .

        In one recent study, researchers found the specific antioxidant content in strawberries might help control cholesterol levels.
        Participants with high cholesterol who were given a diet rich in strawberries showed a reduction in LDL ("bad") cholesterol
        similar to a control group given oat bran supplementation . Combined with its high vitamin content, strawberries'
        cholesterol-checking effect makes this fruit a dietary dual threat (triple, if you count taste).

        Strawberries are a tasty, low-calorie treat (49 calories per serving), but it doesn’t even take much to reap their nutritional
        benefits. Just one cup of the dimpled diva more than satisfies the daily requirement for vitamin C (75 milligrams
        per day for women and 90 for men). An 8-ounce serving also packs more than a quarter of the suggested daily value
        of manganese, along with a respectable 3 grams of dietary fiber. But take caution! While these succulent fruits may
        seem like nature’s golden child, beware of strawberry allergies.


    </p>
    <p>
        More common among infants and children, these allergies can lead to swelling and tingling in the mouth, watery and itchy
        eyes, runny nose, asthma, and sneezing. More severe symptoms are rare, but avoid strawberries and consult with a
        physician if even mild allergic symptoms occur. Strawberries are a heavenly treat, especially when they’re in season
        (April in Florida and Texas, May in the deep South, and June in Northern states). Stock up now before the season
        comes to a close!
