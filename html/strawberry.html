            <h1>Strawberries</h1>
            <p>
                    The star player in strawberries is vitamin C, an antioxidant
                     that helps build and repair the body’s tissues, boosts
                    immunity, and fights excess free radical damage. Studies
                    also suggest vitamin C promotes healthy eye function and
                    might even inhibit wrinkle formation (at least in mice!)
                    . In one recent study, researchers found the specific
                    antioxidant content in strawberries might help control
                    cholesterol levels. Participants with high cholesterol
                    who were given a diet rich in strawberries showed a reduction
                    in LDL ("bad") cholesterol similar to a control group given
                    oat bran supplementation . Combined with its high vitamin
                    content, strawberries' cholesterol-checking effect makes
                    this fruit a dietary dual threat (triple, if you count taste).
                    Strawberries are a tasty, low-calorie treat (49 calories per serving),
                    but it doesn’t even take much to reap their nutritional benefits.
                    Just one cup of the dimpled diva more than satisfies the daily
                    requirement for vitamin C (75 milligrams per day for women and 90 for men).
                    An 8-ounce serving also packs more than a quarter of the suggested daily
                    value of manganese, along with a respectable 3 grams of dietary fiber.
                    But take caution! While these succulent fruits may seem like nature’s
                    golden child, beware of strawberry allergies. More common among infants 
                    and children, these allergies can lead to swelling and tingling in the mouth, 
                    watery and itchy eyes, runny nose, asthma, and sneezing. More severe symptoms 
                    are rare, but avoid strawberries and consult with a physician if even mild 
                    allergic symptoms occur. Strawberries are a heavenly treat, especially when 
                    they’re in season (April in Florida and Texas, May in the deep South, and June 
                    in Northern states). Stock up now before the season comes to a close!
